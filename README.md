Hi! This is a General Repostitory for all the personal projects I have worked on.
The Projects Include:

1) An End to End Machine Learning Project(Within the Folder Machine Learning Projects)
This is my first experience with the Machine Learning Pipeline and Principles. This folder contains a .ipynb file which utilises the corressponding dataset to implement a Regression based model to predict Housing Prices based on several related attributes.

 2) Prometheus
This is the first real python project I've worked on, it was during my class 12th. This code is essentially a chatbot without Machine or Deep Learning principles, yet it is what sparked my interest in the subject. This project uses various python libraries to create a virtual assistant which acts like a lite version of siri or alexa, with voice command to open specific websites or to search the web.

3) Pygame 
This folder contains a basic space invaders style game I have created using the Pygame library
